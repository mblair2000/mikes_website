		<strong>About Me</strong>
		<br>
		<img src="ProfilePic.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="float:right;width:300px;height:50%;padding-right:25px;padding-left:25px;">
		<br>
		
		I just finished up my Junior year at Virginia Tech in the department of Engineering as a computer science major with a minor in Mathematics. I've always been fond of
		computer science and problem solving. Being able to figure out ways to solve problems through different approaches. My favorite language to write code in is Java as
		I've been writing Java the longest. My introduction to computer science was a college-level course in high school. It was a block-coding course that taught the basics
		of computer science and I fell in love. It was the only course I ever took in high school where I'd get an A on a project, but keep working on the code to make it cooler
		and better. That was the year I went to my professor to start teaching myself Java on the side. I have since taught myself HTML5 and a little bit of CSS and JS, along with a plethora of other
		languages at school. Besides Java, most of my work here at VT is done in C. I run everything through a linux terminal on a VM. My current interests lie in learning more
		about containers and bare metal, continuing my self-teaching in front end languages (Javascript right now), and figuring what I'd like to do with my career. Also note, if you'd
		like to view my GitHub projects please email me as most of them are private because of the Honor Code here at VT.

		Outside of computer science, my hobbies include basketball, football, hiking, and going to the gym. At school, I am a part of the AI/ML club although in all honesty I don't
		go too often anymore. I am also an active member in the Alpha Phi chapter of
		<a href="https://www.instagram.com/vt_beta/" target="_blank">Beta Theta Pi</a>
		on campus. The past few years, we have maintained the top GPA of all Greek life on campus and displayed immense philanthropic endeavors. Notable events include working
		with Habitat for Humanity to work on the historic
