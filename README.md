HTML and CSS code that I wrote for my personal website I dynamically host on AWS S3


I spent 4 days learning HTML5 and CSS this week in order to create and host a dynamic website on AWS S3. I learned and wrote all the code seen myself. I bought my domain name through AWS and used Route 53 to point my domain name to my S3 bucket. This makes my normal domain usable in order to get to my website. Note the https protocol is not currently supported with AWS S3 and I didn't make another pointer bucket with the www. prefix to point to my bucket. I'll attatch the link below in this readme file.
