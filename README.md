HTML and CSS code that I wrote for my website I dynamically host on AWS S3


I spent 4 days learning HTML5 and CSS this week in order to create and host a dynamic website on AWS S3. I learned and wrote all the code seen myself. I plan to buy my own domain name and point it to my website through Route 53 in the coming days. For some reason it's taking longer than expected to purchase my domain name right now through AWS. I'll put the current URL down below for now and update it once I get my domain name for the website.
